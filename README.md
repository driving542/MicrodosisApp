# MicrodosisApp
An app to display the content of the book "Microdosis".

Frustrated with the editorial industry, I decided to publish my own works digitally. 

This app contains a collection of poems called "Microdosis". 

The user will be able to read the poems, by turning pages. This app/book has the following features:

1. A "Favorites" feature, that will allow the reader/user to bookmark certain poems, and have them in a list. 
2. A "Bookmark" feature, to mark a desired page and the option to navigate there directly. 
3. A "About" section, to learn (a little bit) about the author.

This project was built using React Native, and for some of its features, I used the following: 

 - Redux
 - Animatable
 - React-native-swipe-list-view
 - React Navigation
 - Expo Font
 - FlatIcons by FreePik <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/rhombus" title="rhombus icons">Rhombus icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>


The poems themselves are written in Spanish, but for presentation purposes, the app's navigation, menus, and some screens, are in English. English version of the poems will come soon.
