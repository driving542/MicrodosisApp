# AutoscopiaApp
An app to display the content of the book "Autoscopia", by Jo Almeyra.

Frustrated with the editorial industry, she decided to publish her own books, and went on to explore different media. I helped her with a digital version. 

This app contains a collection of poems called "Autoscopia". 

The user will be able to read the poems, by turning pages. This app/book has the following features:

1. A "Favorites" feature, that will allow the reader/user to bookmark certain poems, and have them in a list. 
2. A "Bookmark" feature, to mark a desired page and the option to navigate there directly. 
3. A "About" section, to learn (a little bit) about the author.

This project was built using React Native, and the following frameworks for its features: 

 - Redux
 - Animatable
 - React-native-swipe-list-view
 - React Navigation
 - Expo Font
 - FlatIcons by FreePik <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/rhombus" title="rhombus icons">Rhombus icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>


The poems themselves are written in Spanish, but for presentation purposes, the app's navigation, menus, and some screens, are in English. English version of the poems will come soon (I'll ask Jo to translate them).
