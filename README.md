# AutoscopiaApp
An app to display the content of the book "Autoscopia", written by Jo Almeyra.

Frustrated with the editorial industry, she decided to publish her own books, and went on to explore different media. I helped her with a digital version. 

This app contains a collection of poems called "Autoscopia". The user will be able to read the poems, by turning pages. This app/book has the following features:

1. Drawer navigation plus stack navigation
2. A "Favorites" feature, that will allow the reader/user to bookmark certain poems, and have them in a list (Redux) 
3. A "Bookmark" feature, to mark a desired page and the option to navigate there directly. (Redux) 
4. A "About" section, to learn (a little bit) about the author.

This project was built using React Native, and the following frameworks for its features: 

 - Redux
 - React Navigation (Drawer and Stack)
 - Animatable
 - React-native-swipe-list-view
 - Expo Font

The poems themselves are written in Spanish, but for presentation purposes, the app's navigation, menus, and some screens, are in English. English version of the poems will come soon (I'll ask for a translation).
